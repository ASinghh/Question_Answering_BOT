# Semantic Answer Retrival from Wikipedia Articles
## Introduction
In this project I will walk you through the steps required to deploy an Answer Retrival chatbot. The project is a complete solution. It includes a program to parse wikipedia articles (text only, it doesnot parse tables), a backend, and a GUI. The UI is setup as a user-assisted chatbot. The user makes selections from the top 3 predicitons made by the backend. User journey is tracked and stored in a feedback file. The data stored in the feedback file could be used to train custom layer that sits on top of the pre-trained model, inorder to increase the effectiveness for specific use cases.
